# Rapping Rabble Rouser

_Archivist's note: this mouse says some weird stuff, and even the Exploration Team doesn't understand what some of it means. If this occurs again, incomprehensible gibberish will be withheld from future reports and the archive._

This mouse grew up in the sewers, and picked up rapping from mousinem, the greatest mouse rapper in the sewage system. Drop a beat and watch this mouse distract even the most laser-focused blabbering criminal from their monologue, for they'll all be throwing their paws in the air and jiving to his rhythm. 

He even claims that sometimes, his rap is so lit it even pleases the Saint!

This is indisputably the mouse's best rap:

trap's arm is heavy, spring set, charms are crazy,  
there's targets on the cheese already, jack's monterey  
he's anxious, but on the surface he begs ronza and larry  
to drop bits, but he keeps forgettin'  
what bait to use, the trap check's coming now  
he moves his mouse, but the server goes down  
he's workin', how, his bosses be lookin' now  
the clocks run out, times up over, meow  
snap back to FTAs, oop there goes FTC  
oop there goes his TE, he flipped  
he's so mad, he gonna swipe that premium kit  
he can't have it, he knows his whole bank's to be broke  
it won't matter, he's hope, he knows that, but it's smoke  
it's so stagnant, progress, when he goes back to his meadow home,   
that's when it's  
back to discord again, yo, this whole whinery  
better go screenshot the moment and pray for more TAs  

you better lose yourself in the GAs, in the pepeg,   
you are it, you better never let mods know  
you only got one strike, do not miss the rigged roll  
this whale community has auras for a lifetime
