# Abbreviating Archbishop Mouse
<img src="../../assets/abbishop.png" alt="Abbreviating Archbishop">
Some time after being accepted into the shrine, this mouse began to ruthlessly abbreviate everything it said, increasing the lexical value per word of its utterances. 

"LOL!  The H's minluck was one below, I swiped some B and he FTC-ed!  PTS, PTS!" 
(Laugh out loud, the hunter's minimum luck was one below, I swiped some bait and he failed to catch!   Praise the Saint, Praise the Saint!" 

It had realised that it's not the quantity of one's word that matters, but the quality of the words that truly pleases the Saint.

Or as per its mantra, 
"Why say lot word when few word do trick?"

This mantra too, did not escape abbreviation, now when it encounters other Archmoushops, they greet each other with a 'Why word when?' leaving newcomers quite befuddled.
