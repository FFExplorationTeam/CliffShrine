# Sneaky Stagebuilder Mouse

Nobody understands how this mouse is so strong: he might be the most powerful one recorded yet! During festivities, this mouse is often hired to assist in setting the stage properly by both mice and humans alike. In the past, he has often been hired by the King to help set up for special events. This makes him close friends with Larry and a lot of the other builder and architect mice, while also being the archnemesis of the Glitchpaw mouse.

Do not expect to catch this mouse, he is too powerful, even for effects that would otherwise guarantee you a catch. Thankfully, this is a benevolent sneaky little critter , leaving behind equipment or information you could use in exchange for your cheese.
