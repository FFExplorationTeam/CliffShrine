# Queen of the North
<img src="../../assets/QotN.jpg" alt="Queen of the North">

All over gnawnia, stories circulate about an ancient, hateful mouse who shall return to raid gnawnia to rule as its icy queen.

Up in the North, however, there are stories of this mouse before her fall. A benevolent ruler in times before the North froze over, willing to do anything for the wellbeing of her people. As almost the equivalent of a benevolent god of agriculture, she would lead the North through its golden age.

Unfortunately, times changed, the North froze over, the once benevolent Queen was betrayed by her diplomatic allies in the south, forcing her hand into becoming a pillaging menace. This mouse here and now, a mirage of the past preserved through myths, seems unaware of what challenges the future will bring her.
