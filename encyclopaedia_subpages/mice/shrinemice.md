# the Soliloquy Shrine

An eerie but sacred Shrine located in the Folklore Forest, near the Table of Contents. It was first discovered early in July, but is kept secret untill the Royal Exploration Team could document the dangers located within it.

Within the Shrine itself, a cult dedicated to the mysterious Soliloquy Saint resides. At this point in time, very little about the cult itself is known.

Outside the Shrine, two groups can be found: Vengeful Villains and Troublemakers. The Villains are here to lament their misfortune of getting caught, to gain protection from the Shrine for as long as they can keep going. Much to their discontent, the Troublemakers are here to party.
