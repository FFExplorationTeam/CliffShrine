## The Hangers of the Cliff and The Woven

From the depths of the Soliloquy Shrine, multiple books were recovered. Two of these books were The Hangers of the Cliff and The Woven. These books talk about inhabitants of a mysterious cliff and myths regarding Gnawnia's greatest dragons. It is currently assumed that there is a link between the content of these books and a currently unexplored region in the Folklore Forest, but there is currently no evidence to support this.
