# Habitats

This chapter focusses on the environment around the shrine and where the different groups of mice live. 

## the Soliloquy Shrine
An eerie but sacred Shrine located in the Folklore Forest, near the Table of Contents. It was first discovered early in July, but is kept secret untill the Royal Exploration Team could document the dangers located within it.

Within the Shrine itself, a cult dedicated to the mysterious Soliloquy Saint resides. At this point in time, very little about the cult itself is known.

Outside the Shrine, two groups can be found: Vengeful Villains and Troublemakers. The Villains are here to lament their misfortune of getting caught, to gain protection from the Shrine for as long as they can keep going. Much to their discontent, the Troublemakers are here to party.

## the Hanging Cliffs
A mythical cliff that allegedly can be found deep within the Folklore Forest. It is inhabited by mice that vaguely resemble primarily Draconic mice from Gnawnia.  
We currently hope to find more details on the Hanging Cliffs in one of our following reports.
