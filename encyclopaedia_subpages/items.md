# Loot

Despite being a truly strange region, the mice in these lands also drop mysterious loot. An overview of the loots we have either found or heard rumors about can be found here. Once these rumors get some credible source, they will be transitioned to their own dedicated position.

## General Items
### How not to run a Mousecult (book)
One of the books retrieved from the Soliloque Shrine. It talks about how to run an organisation under the guise a religious institution.

### the Hangers of the Cliff (book)
One of the books retrieved from the Soliloque Shrine. It is an encyclopaedia with many myths, most of them talking about the strongest mice that dominate Gnawnia. Next to these myths, it also has a number of more regular mice.

### the Undescribed (book)
One of the books retrieved from the Soliloque Shrine, and seemingly a sequel to the Hangers of the Cliff. Unfortunately, this book was mostly torn apart, obscuring the potential horrors documented in it.

## Rapper's Ramblings
The following items have been described by the Rapping Rabble Rouser we found at the side of the road
### Fake Flashcards
Made-up words, but surprisingly neat  
Fake Flashcards are here so you don't miss a beat  
I'm sure you'll never find a pair  
willing to bet on my very last chair

### Literary Device:
When words don't make sense, are bland on their own  
Fill a box 'till it's dense, get a phrase on a loan  
value's up, it's immense, even found the right tone  
at your flashcards' expense, something you should've known

### Broken Records
Used to be famous but wasn't that good
Got overplayed, without reading the mood
Now noone really likes it, or knows the chords
but it might distract some, for what that's worth

### Smash Hits
No matter your focus, this will break it
for noone can withstand a true smash hit
it might be the best you'll ever hear
so just accept and grab a beer
