# the Soliloque Shrine Project

Upon outwriting the Mythweaver, it frantically scribbles something on a tattered piece of parable papyrus, opening an unknown path deeper into folklore forest.  
Two paths reveal themselves, heading towards a mysterious Shrine and a bottomless cliff.  

A lot of odd things are going on with this region, both with regards to how Gnawnia's folklore has changed when it appeared and with the mice in it. For this reason, it is not open for hunters yet, but we will dedicate ourselves to exploring this area further.

## Disclaimer

All images included here are fanmade and inspired greatly by the game this is based on, namely [Mousehunt](https://www.mousehuntgame.com/) [(HitGrab)](https://hitgrab.com/). If you didn't know that game already, then I'm quite curious on how you ended up here, but that's not the pont here. This is an entirely unofficial project, so please do NOT bother the game's devs with any issues regarding this project.
