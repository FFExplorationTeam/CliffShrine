# Looking Glass Incident #2, Report 2
---
The initial exploration of the Folklore Forest has shown that reality in this place seems to reform based on the thought of those observing. For this reason, according to Royal Decree 9, this, as well as any other report in name of His Majesty the King, will include any reasonable opinion, interpretation and hunch regarding the explored area.

Soon after the previous report, we managed to approach the Shrine. Outside the Shrine, two mice group were present: Vengeful Villains and Troublemakers.

The Vengeful Villains are all former criminals on the run for prosecution. They are swarmed around the outter walls of the shrine, monologuing as if their life depends on it. After all, it does: the only thing guarding them is the myth of the Saint, protecting those around the Shrine as long as their speech keeps going.

To assist themselves with this endeavour, these shady figures have some tools at their disposal. Firstly, there are Fake Flashcards. These contain exotic words that help them stay original. Some of these words, like 'grass', may be foreign to you, but what makes a word real anyway.
The second are Literary Devices. These are magical little boxes that you can fill up with Fake Flashcards, which then in turn will transform into a Protected Phrase, which is guaranteed to be original, and will surely grab the attention of the mice inside the sanctum

The second group, the Troublemakers, are quite different. They live for two things: music and festivals. Some of them are experienced in making music or assisting in the organisation of such events, but most of them are just loud. This clearly upsets the Vengeful Villains, who aim to do nothing but stay focussed on their own monologues to stay safe.

One of these troublemakers is our dear ally Rodentriguez, the Sneaky Stagebuilder who has helped me with the setup of numerous major events in the past. In exchange for some juicy [cheesename], we managed to convince him to go steal some books from inside the Shrine.

The first one is called 'how to run not a Mousecult', which was hidden in the Abbreviating Archbishop's room. This book details how go steer a shady organisation without your definitely-not-cultists figuring out.
While we don't have any actual information on the inside workings of the Shrine, we can make some educated guesses using this book. Some of the marked sections described the following:
-Create and spread impossible myths promising salvation for the lost to attract the hopeless with nowhere left to run.
-To ensure loyalty, create an artifical, symbolic and difficult requirement to join the group
-To ensure an easily controllable hierarchy, make sure the internal power structure values the opposite of what is needed to enter
-Do not let any other group member read this book
This seems to imply that while verbosity is needed to enter the Shrine, silence and listening would be more valued inside. It also could mean that the Soliloquy Saint doesn't actually exist, but considering we are deep in the Folklore Forest, caution on this end is still warranted.

The second book is titled 'the Hangers of the Cliff'. While its  general design hints at it being an encyclopedia, it is primarily filled with myths from before human records. One example is the story of the Empress of the North, a dragon that fed agriculture in the unexplored lands north of the Toxic Spill. While the story ends with vaguely suggesting a potential fall in its near future, the illustrations hint that this mouse may end up being the threat we now know as Icewing.
Next to these mythical stories, it also has some normal encyclopedic entries like the Ginger Gatherer.
Considering Rodentriguez' skill at gathering useful information, we are somewhat confused about why he returned with this book, but we assume time will tell. Maybe the other path revealed by the Mythweaver can tell us more about this.

The third book seems to be a sequel to The Hangers of the Cliff, titled 'The Unwritten'. The entire book is ripped apart and covered with blood, and terrified our mouse experts. They had definitely seen worse, making their fear unusual. The only thing left readable was a brief description on the back cover, talking about how this was a book talking about those who have never been described before.
